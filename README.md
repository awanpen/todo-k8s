## 📝 What is todo-k8s?

todo-k8s is a task management app that uses artificial intelligence to help you organize your to-do list. It has a built-in chat assistant that can understand your task needs and suggest what to do next. The app runs smoothly on modern web browsers and keeps your data safe with a reliable database.

The app is built with proven technologies like Next.js for the user interface, FastAPI to run the backend services, and PostgreSQL for storing information. It also uses a smart AI model called Groq Llama 3.3 to provide helpful chat responses. The whole app runs on a powerful platform called Kubernetes, managed through Helm for easy updates and stability.
